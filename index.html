  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>Berners-Lee NeXT computer, the world's first web server was used to, and this time with the first web browser, the European Particle Physics Laboratory has been recorded as the World Wide Web around the second quarter of 1990 was working on (CERN) it flowed. The first successful builds were completed on Christmas in 1990, and the builds that followed were used by Berners-Lee's CERN colleagues before official release to the Internet newsgroup in August 1991 . During this time, Bernd Pollermann, Robert Cailliau, Jean-Fran√ßois Groff, and Nicola Pello ( linemode browser developer) participated in the project.

Berners-Lee and Grof later created the libwww API , employing many of the components of the World Wide Web as C programming language versions .

Numerous early browsers appeared, and the most prominent among them was ViolaWWW . All of these browsers were obscured by Mosaic 's popularity until 1993 and replaced the World Wide Web program. This has led me to focus on other work defining standards and guidelines for the development of the World Wide Web . (For example, HTML , various communication protocols, etc.)

On April 30, 1993, CERN's Board of Directors released the World Wide Web's source code in the public domain as free software . Some versions of this software can still be downloaded from the evolt.org browser repository . Berners-Lee initially considered releasing it under the GNU General Public License , but in order to maximize the company's support, it was eventually posted to the public domain.</p>
